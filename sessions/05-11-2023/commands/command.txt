Setup Ansible on lab environment
-------------------------------------

    1.2 Establish SSH key pair in linux system to have SSH connectivity with localhost using the following commands:
    ssh-keygen -t rsa (Press Enter when asked for File and Paraphrase details)
    
    cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys
    ssh localhost -p 42006
    (Type yes when prompted)
    

    1.3 Now, add the host localhost in ansible host file /etc/ansible/hosts
    sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
        
    1.4 When the file opens, add the below two lines of the code at the end of the file:
    [webservers]
    localhost:42006

    ansible -m ping webservers

    Step 2: Add YAML script to the playbook to install node

    2.1 Open the node.yaml file by using the below command 2.2 and then add the following code



    Step 3: Run Ansible YAML script
    
    ansible-playbook node.yml



Create and work with your Ansible roles
------------------------------------------------------

    1.1 Establish SSH key pair in Linux system to establish SSH connectivity with the localhost using the following commands:

    ssh-keygen -t rsa
    cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys
    ssh localhost -p 42006
    

    1.2 Now, add the host localhost in ansible host file /etc/ansible/hosts

    sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts

    1.3 When the file opens, add the below lines of code under [webservers]:

    [webservers]
    localhost:42006 ansible_ssh_user=<Your user name> ansible_ssh_pass=<Your Passowrd>
        
    Note: Add the username and password of the lab you are using. You can access those using the RDP access tab.

    
    Step 2: Create Ansible Role

    2.1 Once we have our Ansible environment ready, next create a project. I will create a 
    new project base to demonstrate Ansible roles example

    mkdir base

    2.2 To create an ansible role, use ansible-galaxy init <role_name> to create the role 
    directory structure

    2.3 Letâ€™s create the role in our <project>/roles directory i.e. ~/base/roles/motd

    cd base
    mkdir roles
    cd roles
    ansible-galaxy init demor
        

    2.4 You can use the ls command to list the ansible role directory structure

    cd demor
    ls
    
    Step 3: Create Ansible Tasks

    3.1 Now update the /etc/motd file using ansible playbook roles. Create tasks to use the main.yml file present inside the tasks folder.

    cd tasks
    ls
    vi main.yml
    
    3.2 Enter the below code
    ---
    # tasks file for demor
    - name: copy demor file
    template:
        src: templates/demor.j2
        dest: /etc/demor
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: 0444


    Step 4: Create Ansible Template
    4.1 Create the template content which will be used to update /etc/motd in our ansible roles examples. I will create a new template file under the templates directory using some variables:

    cd ..
    cd templates
    vi demor.j2
    
    4.2 Enter the below details:

    Welcome to {{ ansible_hostname }}

    This file was created on {{ ansible_date_time.date }}
    Go away if you have no business being here

    Contact {{ system_manager }} if anything is wrong

    
    Step 5: Create Ansible Variable

    5.1 We will use the defaults folder to define custom variables which are used in our template file templates/demor.j2

    cd ..
    cd defaults
    ls
    vi main.yml
    
    5.2 Enter the below details in the file:
    ---
    # defaults file for demor
    system_manager: admin@golinuxcloud.com
    

    Step 6: Remove unwanted directories (Optional)

    6.1 This step is completely optional. In this ansible roles example, we will not use other directories so we are deleting them. After deleting the additional directories you can use the tree command to list the directory structure of motd roles

    cd ..
    rm -rf handlers tests vars
    

    Step 7: Create an ansible-role playbook

    7.1 Now after you create an ansible role structure, we need a playbook file that will deploy the role to our managed hosts. I will create my playbook file demor-role.yml under base project directory
    cd ..
    cd ..
    sudo vi demor-role.yml

    

    7.2 Enter the below code in the file

    ---
    - name: use demor role playbook
    hosts: webservers
    user: ansible
    become: true

    roles:
        - role: demor
        system_manager: admin@golinuxcloud.com


    
    Step 8: Deploy Ansible role playbook
    8.1 Execute the below command:
    ansible-playbook demor-role.yml

    Note: In case you get an error asking you to install sshpass program as shown below, execute the command: sudo apt install sshpass and then run the ansible-playbook demor-role.yml command.

##For reference you can find the 'demor' role under '05-11-2-23/ansible/base/'
